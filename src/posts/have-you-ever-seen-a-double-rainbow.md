Double rainbow is an incredibly beautiful natural phenomenon, but not very frequent, unfortunately. It is caused by the double reflection of sunlight in the raindrops. It is curious that in the second rainbow the colors go in the opposite order: from violet to red.  
  
Popular signs consider the double rainbow a very good sign, promising success, and good luck in everything. It is said that this doubled beauty is sent to people as a reward for all the troubles they have experienced recently.  
  
Well, this year such a wonderful sign would be useful to all of us, what do you think?
