On June 5, the second lunar eclipse of this year will be observed in the sky, which will also coincide with the full moon.  
  
The eclipse will be clearly visible in different parts of the world: the inhabitants of Asia, Australia, Europe, Africa, South America and southwestern Russia will be able to observe it.  
  
The maximum visibility phase will be at 19:25 UTC. The entire period of the lunar eclipse will last 3 hours 18 minutes, from 17:45 to 21:04 UTC.  
  
However, since this eclipse is of partial shade, one should not expect the complete disappearance of the Moon: the celestial body will acquire a more saturated color, but no more than 57% of the lunar disk will be in the shadow.
